Things to do

1. Parse input
  -Parse .var files
    -Store as a map (dynamically chosen)
      -Key is variable name (A,B,C,...)
      -Value are the list of values for each variable
  -Parse .con files
    -Store as a list of char arrays
2. Classes
    -Class node holds the map, and an assignment array
    -assignment array holds ASCII value of variable, and assignment
      -EX A:1,B:4,C:5 = [65,1,66,4,67,5]
        -Can use array when printing out assignment
    -Classes will be connected via Linked List
Class Methods
  a. Heuristics
      -choosing variable heuristic (smallest)
      -choosing value (least constrained)
  b. Forward checking alg
      -one variable at a time
        -check constraints to make sure they don't fail
          -if failed, changed the variable that made it fail
      -loop this 30 times or until solved.
  c. Backwards checking

3. Order of check
        1. Create initial node object
        2. Assign first var a value using heuristics and store in array
        3. Make new node a copy of current and make it next in LinkedList
        4. Based on array, trim values in map.
        5. Constraint check
          a. If passes, repeat 2-5
          b. If fails, output array, move to previous node, delete node, then repeat 2-5
        6. Increment counter
